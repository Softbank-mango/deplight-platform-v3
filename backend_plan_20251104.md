# Deployment System 4-Day Delivery Plan

## Goals
- Deliver a GitHub→AWS deployment pipeline leveraging OIDC and Terraform CLI automation.
- Ensure artifact tagging propagates from CI to Terraform/ECS with rollback and observability coverage.
- Integrate the AI Code Analyzer workflow to feed Terraform variables and recommendations.
- Produce runbook-level documentation with smoke tests, notifications, and handover assets.

## Constraints
- 4 calendar days, 3–4 team members with ~12 focused hours/day (buffers preserved).
- GitHub Actions, Terraform CLI, AWS ECS/CodeDeploy, AI Analyzer Lambda must be used as given.
- Prefer short-lived credentials; no long-lived AWS keys stored in GitHub.
- Tasks sized 2–5 hours, respecting dependencies and critical path.
- Network access restricted; external tooling additions require approval.

## Interfaces & Data Models
- GitHub OIDC → AWS IAM role using `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.
- Docker image tagged with `<commit_sha>` pushed to ECR; tag passed as Terraform variable during CLI apply.
- AI Code Analyzer Lambda consumes `.delightful.yaml` + repo, outputs PR comments and `generated/terraform.tfvars.json` in S3, possibly scaffolds modules under `infrastructure/`.
- Terraform CLI runs from GitHub Actions using remote state (S3 + DynamoDB locking) with environment variables for backend configuration.
- GitHub Actions workflows: Analyzer workflow and CI/CD workflow (build/test/SCA → push image → Terraform apply → CodeDeploy → smoke tests → Slack + PR updates).

- Dependencies: T-02, T-03  
- Effort: 4h | Priority: Must | Risk: High — orchestrates whole deployment path.  
- Acceptance: Workflow completes build + plan stages on sample branch with manual apply approval.

[ ] `T-06` Propagate image tag into Terraform apply (Critical Path)  
- Scope: In — capture commit SHA, pass to Terraform CLI via `-var=image_tag`, ensure outputs update ECS; Out — alternative tag naming schemes.  
- Dependencies: T-05  
- Effort: 3h | Priority: Must | Risk: Medium — incorrect tag breaks ECS rollout.  
- Acceptance: ECS task definition updated with expected `image_tag` after apply.

## Assumptions & Open Questions

| Type | Item | Proposed Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assumption | AWS account, ECR repo, and Terraform backend resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table) already exist with admin access for the team. | Confirm credentials on Day 1; escalate if missing. |
| Assumption | AI Analyzer Lambda is deployed and reachable with required IAM permissions. | Validate ARN and IAM policy before T-07. |
| Assumption | Slack workspace & webhook for deployment notifications available. | Obtain or create channel during Day 3. |
| Open Question | Are multiple environments (staging/prod) required in this 4-day window? | Default to single staging-like environment; await sponsor decision to duplicate. |
| Open Question | Should CodeDeploy blue/green include traffic shifting tests beyond smoke checks? | Propose simple health check only unless stakeholder provides additional scripts. |
| Open Question | Who owns long-term Terraform backend (S3/Dynamo) access and approvals post-handover? | Need named owner for access control before Day 4. |

## Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Trigger | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | OIDC trust misconfiguration blocks AWS access. | High | Medium | Pair review trust policy, test via sandbox job. | GitHub workflow fails to assume role. | Platform Engineer A |
| R-02 | Terraform apply drifts existing resources when analyzer tfvars misalign. | High | Medium | Manual review gate for analyzer outputs; diff alerts. | `terraform plan` shows destructive changes. | Platform Engineer B |
| R-03 | Analyzer Lambda latency exceeds GitHub workflow timeout. | Medium | Low | Increase timeout, add retry/backoff, capture CloudWatch metrics. | Workflow cancels analyzer step. | DevOps Engineer |
| R-04 | CodeDeploy rollback not triggered due to missing alarms. | High | Low | Validate alarms + deployment config in staging before prod. | Blue/green deployment hangs post-traffic shift. | DevOps Engineer |
| R-05 | Slack/notification failures hide deployment status. | Medium | Medium | Add fallback PR comment and CloudWatch event log. | Slack webhook errors or auth failure. | QA/Tech Writer |
